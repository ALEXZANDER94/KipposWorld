# KipposWorld

A 2D side scroller created entirely in Python using the pygame framework. 

These are just the python files. The assets can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/utnfx6gge5yvffc/KipposWorldAssets.zip?dl=0
These must be extracted and place in the top-most folder

The game is equipped with 3 playable characters - an archer, wizard, and warrior. 

There isn't much to say about the game because of the simplicity behind it. There is quite a lot of aesthetic from it, although I put an extra amount of attention to detail in the 
programming concepts.
