# KipposWorld

A 2D side scroller created entirely in Python using the pygame framework. 

These are just the python files. The assets can be downloaded here: 

The game is equipped with 3 playable characters - an archer, wizard, and warrior. 

There isn't much to say about the game because of the simplicity behind it. There is quite a lot of aesthetic from it, although I put an extra amount of attention to detail in the 
programming concepts.
